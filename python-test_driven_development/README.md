# Python - Test Driven Development

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and focuses on
Test Driven Development (TDD) using Python. The goal is to write reliable
and well-documented code by validating it with tests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is powerful and widely used
- Understand what interactive tests are
- Recognize the importance of testing in software development
- Write doctests using docstrings
- Document Python modules and functions properly
- Use basic test option flags
- Identify and test edge cases

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Python 3.8.5
- All files end with a new line
- First line of each file: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code follows `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files are executable
- File length checked using `wc`
- A README.md file is mandatory

### Python Test Cases
- All test files are inside the `tests` directory
- Doctests use `.txt` files
- Unittests use `.py` files
- Run doctests with:
  ```bash
  python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
Run unittests with:

python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test
All modules and functions include proper documentation
