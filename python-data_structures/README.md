# Python Data Structures

## Project Overview
This project focuses on fundamental Python data structures: lists, tuples, and strings.  
It includes exercises to practice list manipulation, tuple operations, string handling, and sequence concepts.

You will learn to:  
- Access and modify elements in lists  
- Use lists as stacks and queues  
- Apply list comprehensions  
- Work with tuples, including packing and unpacking  
- Handle sequences and the `del` statement  
- Perform operations on matrices and strings  

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
- All scripts must be executable  
- Follow pycodestyle (v2.7.*)  
- No external modules should be imported  
- Files must end with a new line
