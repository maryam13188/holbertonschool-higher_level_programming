##Python - Serialization

## 📌 Overview

This project explores data serialization and deserialization in Python using different formats including JSON, Pickle, CSV, and XML.

The goal is to understand how data can be converted into a transferable format and reconstructed back into Python objects.

## 📂 Tasks
0. Basic Serialization

Implemented JSON serialization and deserialization for Python dictionaries:

serialize_and_save_to_file

load_and_deserialize

1. Pickling Custom Classes

Created a custom class and implemented object serialization using the pickle module:

Instance method: serialize

Class method: deserialize

2. CSV to JSON Conversion

Converted CSV data into JSON format using:

csv.DictReader

json module

3. XML Serialization & Deserialization

Implemented XML serialization and reconstruction using:

xml.etree.ElementTree

serialize_to_xml

deserialize_from_xml

## 🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

json

pickle

csv

xml.etree.ElementTree

## 🎯 Concepts Covered

Serialization vs Deserialization

Data persistence

Object state reconstruction

Working with structured data formats
